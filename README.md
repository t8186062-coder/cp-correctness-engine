# CP Correctness Engine

A C++ correctness engine that automatically finds and minimizes counterexamples
for incorrect competitive programming solutions using brute-force verification.

## What it does
- Generates random test cases
- Compares a candidate solution against a correct reference
- Detects discrepancies
- Minimizes failing inputs via delta debugging

## Example (Loyalty Problem)
